   This is note text. Use a note for information you want the user to
   pay particular attention to.

   the same level as the note tag. If formatting is incorrect, part of the note
   might not render in the HTML output.

   indent to the same level as the rest of the note.

   to the same level as the warning tag. If formatting is incorrect, part of
   the warning might not render in the HTML output.

   Warnings can have more than one paragraph. Successive paragraphs must
